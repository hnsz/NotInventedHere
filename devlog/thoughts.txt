This documentation contains my thoughts on stuff i encounter.



                    Switching from eclipse to newbeans was the best choice I ever made
                    

	Task 1

Get a better place for this log.
A wiki or something.



	Routing Resources, Access Control and URL Rewriting

Several options to create the request part of the route
Would like to have each operation including their parameters to be a resource request that is handled as one route
with a specific path and an Access Rule (though it could be part of a (inherited) class of rules)
This way it's clear when a user is allowed a certain operation and when not.
And could come in handy later for caching purposes

You have an actual URI and you have the requested path that is used as the key in the routing table
Call it for now the VirtualUri. 
Now decide which part of the URI should become the VirtualUri.
Option
use the REQUEST_URI (in php $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] and ignore the QUERY_STRING entirely
	example: /index.php/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx/credentials
	easily rewritten from exmple.com/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx/credentials
use the REQUEST_URI for routing and still use the QUERY_STRING for some parameters 
	this would violate the each operation has a path rule (occasionally) but it's practical
	example: /index.php/login?pleasetakemeto=/index.php/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx
	  versus: /index.php/login/pleasetakemeto/index.php/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx
		which would be a bit silly to have to route
	  prettified:
		example: /login?pleasetakemeto=/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx
		 versus: /login/pleasetakemeto/adminpanel/editmemberaccount/examplememberx
			on the other hand does look kind of nice

                        What links should look like, what is the right order? (there isn't any)

Some different looking links that point to the same thing. Should pick some convention. It really doesn't matter too much. 
Thought there are some interesting possibilities when you get to things like search filters and function chaining
        /member/profile/jane-doe
        /profile/jane-doe
        /profile/jane-doe/edit
        /profile/jane-doe/view
        /edit/profile/jane-doe
        /view/profile/jane-doe

        /editaccount/jane-doe/profile
        /jane-doe/editaccount/profile
        /editaccount/profile
        /editaccount/self/profile

        /editmemberaccount/jane-doe/profile
        /adminpanel/editmemberaccount/jane-doe/profile (it's the way teh cookie crumbles.. or bread)
        
        /admin_panel/edit_member_account/jane-doe/profile
        /admin_panel/member_account/jane-doe/profile
        /admin_panel/member/jane-doe/edit_account/profile


	Routing Table and URI based Access Rule List

Can of worms ahaid
Having an acces rule for each profile page isn't that much of a problem. Not yet anyway.
Once you get more users it becomes a problem.
With N users you have N*N access rules for viewing a profile page 
and N rules for editing the profile page.
That is if you use a URI like /member/examplename/profile and /member/examplename/profile/edit

But with a routes file it becomes a bit tedious to manage
Also it just not feasible on the long run. However I didn't plan to keep it this way.
Later iterations I would like to use wildcards like star (e.g. /member/*/profile  and /member/*/profile/edit)
A request could easily be mapped onto this pattern by the Router
using preg_match would be be an option, str_replace would be cheaper 

AccesRules depend a little bit on routes table
They are based on the routes table and the routes table is used when the amin adds new accessrules
For now just make a route for each user. Having rules based on wildcards in a userinterface is potentially insecure as
an admin could get confused about what is what.

Also indexing of the routes table would be an option


	Nicknames
Multiple users should be allowed to have the same nickname
But there must then be an internal nickname with a number added and a cosmetic plain nickname.
Say you have two users (johndoe@somethingmiraculous.com and johndeer@trucker.com)
Their main unique identifier to the WEBSITE owner should be their e-mail address.
At the same time their e-mail should remain private. 
They both should be allowed to have the same nickname (e.g. john and john)
Their userId could be used to create a unique URI for their profile page though it would be nicer to use  their nick with an added numer to make it unique
(e.g. for john doe /member/john/0001/profile and for john deer /member/john/0002/profile in stead of /member/00022/profile 
and /member/02345/profile)'s 

	Must commit more often and get more organised, work in branches

Just do it


	
	Publish(Model)/Subcriber(View) is neat

How to get it right? At the moment there is just one page that is handled by the defaultpagemodel -view and -controller. 
A superclass that has these things and which has a general setup for generating an html page would be handy but
the downside is that you hide some of the implementation of the templates which actually be nice to have in one overview
It's probably much better to keep things as lateral as possible.
Subscriber/publisher code must however be generic and therfore held in a superclass 
Therefore a view's callback should be attached to a modelevent. 
Right now the controller subscribes its views to the model. 
Does the responsibility for registering callbacks lie with the controller or with the views themselves.



                    Hierarchical MVC

Is something for later concern. When it comes to that the question is, does a view delegate to subviews or does the controller 
delegate to subcontrollers that in turn call their respective views. 
Certainly it's very neat to have all these little subviews/widgets that get notified about updates in the model.



                    EventHandler/EventQueue

This is for way later concern. Have the views subscribe indirectly to the Model via an EventHandler. 
Let the Model publish its Events to the EventHandler and keep a queue perhaps even with a prioritisation scheme 
to decide in which order the events are handled and the callbacks are run.
Would be nice for asynchronous requests and large amounts of data that need to be fed to the client with rolling updates
You've written it down. now forget about it until it becomes relevant.. :)
